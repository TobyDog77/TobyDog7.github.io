Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone, and welcome!

Here I'll post updates, videos, and general posts about everything I am making.
At the time of writing this I'm co-director and the main coder of Undertinge, and I have made a game jam game named Box Poy in the past.

I am also working on a Castlevania-like game, which will feature many inspirations of metroidvanias, not limited to Castlevania. It's called Ciarlan's Quest for now, this is however a name which is a substitute (like "Simon's Quest") for now.

My main goal is to make a game that feels and looks more like Symphony of the Night (SotN), without it having the main character using different weapons, but an upgradable whip. I see many Castlevania inspired games coming soon or which are already released, but none of them really have the SotN art style. (closest one would be Timespinner which is a great game)

A fun fact about this is that I actually only began playing Castlevania games since the end of 2024, which is crazy to think about how I have almost completed every Castlevania game except the Advance Collection, Haunted Castle and Castlevania 64. (not including Lords of Shadows games, since they technically weren't made by one of the Castlevania teams)
