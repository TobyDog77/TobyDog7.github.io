Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone, and welcome!

Here I'll post updates, videos, and general posts about everything I am making.
I'm co-director and the main coder of Undertinge at the time of writing this, but I have made a game jam game named Box Poy in the past.

I am currently also working on a Castlevania-like game, but which will also future many inspirations of metroidvanias, not limited to Castlevania. It's called Ciarlan's Quest for now, but the name is a substitute (like "Simon's Quest") for now.

My main goal is to make it feel and look more like Symphony of the Night (SotN), without it having the main character using different weapons, but an upgradable whip. I see many Castlevania inspired games coming, but none of them really have the SotN art style. (closest one would be Timespinner which is an awesome game imo)

A fun fact about that is that I actually only began playing Castlevania games since the end of 2024, crazy to think about how I almost have completed every Castlevania game except the Advance Collection and Haunted Castle and Castlevania 64. (not including Lords of Shadows games, since they technically weren't made by one of the Castlevania teams)
